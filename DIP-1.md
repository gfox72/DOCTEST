## What is a DIP ? <a name="WhatisaDIP"></a>
DIP stands for Dero Improvement Proposal. A DIP is a design document providing information to the Dero community, describing a new feature or its processes or environment. The DIP provides a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. The DIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

## What makes a successful DIP? <a name="DIPSucces"></a>
Each DIP should have the following parts:

  * **Preamble** - RFC 822 style headers containing metadata about the DIP, including the DIP number, a short descriptive title (limited to a maximum of 44 characters), and the author details. See [below for details](#DipPreamble).
  * **Simple Summary** - “If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough.” Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the DIP.
  * **Abstract** - a short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.
  * **Motivation** (*optional) - The motivation is critical for DIPs that want to change the DERP protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the DIP solves. DIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.
  * **Specification** - The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current DERO platforms **<< NEEDS REVIEW IF APPLICABLE**.
  * **Rationale** - The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.
  * **Backwards Compatibility** - All DIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The DIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. DIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.
  * **Test Cases** - Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for DIPs that are affecting consensus changes. Other DIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.
  * **Implementations** - The implementations must be completed before any DIP is given status “Final”, but it need not be completed before the DIP is merged as draft. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of “rough consensus and running code” is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.
  * **Copyright Waiver** - All DIPs must be in the public domain. See the bottom of this DIP for an example [copyright waiver](#DIPCopyright).
  
## DIP Rationale <a name="DIPRationale"></a>
We intend DIPs to be the primary instrument for proposing new features, for collecting community technical input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have in result gone into Dero. DIPs are maintained as documents with a revision control. For DERO implementers, DIPs are a convenient way to track the progress of their implementation. Ideally each implementation maintainer would list the DIPs that they have implemented. This will give end users a convenient way to know the current status of a given implementation or library.

## DIP Editors <a name="DIPEditors"></a>
The current DIP editors are (discord handles):

  * `Captain - captain#0795` <br/>
  * `Dank - dank#8384` <br/>
  * `Gfox - gfox#0522` <br/>

## DIP Editor Responsibilities
For each new DIP submitted, an editor does the following:
  * Read the DIP to check if it is ready: sound and complete. The ideas must make technical sense, even if they don’t seem likely to get to final status.
  * The title should accurately describe the content.
  * Check the DIP for language (spelling, grammar, sentence structure, etc.), markup, code style.

If the DIP isn’t ready, the editor will send it back to the author for revision with specific instructions.<br/>

Once the DIP is ready for the repository, the DIP editor will:
  *	Assign a DIP number (generally the PR number or, if preferred by the author, the Issue # if there was discussion in the Issues section of this repository about this DIP)
  *	Send a message back to the DIP author with the next step.
  
Most of the DIPs are written and maintained by developers with write access to the DERO codebase. The DIP editors monitor DIP changes and correct any structure, grammar, spelling, or markup mistakes they see.
Editors don’t pass judgment on DIPs, they merely do the administrative & editorial part.

## DIP Types <a name="DIPTypes"></a>
There are three types of DIP:
  *	A **Standard Track DIP** describes any change that affects most or all DERO implementations, such as a change to the network protocol, a change in block or transaction validity rules, proposed application standards/conventions, or any change or addition that affects the interoperability of applications using DERO. Furthermore Standard DIPs can be broken down into the following categories. Standards Track DIPs consist of three parts, a design document, implementation, and finally if warranted an update to the formal specification.
    * **Core** - improvements requiring a consensus fork as well as changes that are not necessarily consensus critical but may be relevant to core dev discussions such as miner/node strategy changes.
    * **Networking** – core dev to comment
    *	**Interface** - includes improvements around client API/RPC specifications and standards and also certain language-level standards. The label “interface” aligns with the interface repository and discussion should primarily occur in that repository before a DIP is submitted to the DIPs repository.
    *	**ERC** - application-level standards and conventions, including contract standards such as token standards, name registries, URI schemes, library/package formats and wallet formats.
  *	A **Meta DIP** describes a process surrounding DERO or proposes a change to (or an event in) a process. Process DIPs are like Standards Track DIPs but apply to areas other than the DERO protocol itself. They may propose an implementation, but not to DERO’s codebase; they often require community consensus; unlike Informational DIPs, they are more than recommendations, and users are typically not free to ignore them. Examples include procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and changes to the tools or environment used in DERO development. Any meta-DIP is also considered a Process DIP.
  *	An **Informational DIP** describes a DERO design issue, or provides general guidelines or information to the DERO community, but does not propose a new feature. Informational DIPs do not necessarily represent DERO community consensus or a recommendation, so users and implementers are free to ignore Informational DIPs or follow their advice.

It is highly recommended that a single DIP contain a single key proposal or new idea. The more focused the DIP, the more successful it tends to be. A change to one client doesn’t require an DIP; a change that affects multiple clients, or defines a standard for multiple apps to use, does.

A DIP must meet certain minimum criteria. It must be a clear and complete description of the proposed enhancement. The enhancement must represent a net improvement. The proposed implementation, if applicable, must be solid and must not complicate the protocol unduly.

## DIP Formats and Templates <a name="DIPFormats"></a>
DIPs should be written in [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) style. Image files should be included in a subdirectory of the `assets` folder for that DIP as follows: `assets/dip-X` (for dip X). When linking to an image in the DIP, use relative links such as `../assets/dip-X/image.png`.

## DIP Workflow <a name="DIPWorkflow"></a>
Parties involved in the process are you, the champion or DIP author, the DIP editors, and the DERO Core Developpers

**:warning:** Before you begin, vet your idea, this will save you time. Ask the DERO community first if an idea is original to avoid wasting time on something that will be rejected based on prior research (searching the Internet does not always do the trick). It also helps to make sure the idea is applicable to the entire community and not just the author. Just because an idea sounds good to the author does not mean it will work for most people in most areas where DERO is used. Examples of appropriate public forums to gauge interest around your DIP include DERO discord (general channel), the DERO Community Advisory Board members or DERO telegram.

Your role as the champion is to write the DIP using the style and format described below, shepherd the discussions in the appropriate forums, and build community consensus around the idea. Following is the process that a successful DIP will move along:

`[WIP] -> [DRAFT] -> [LAST CALL] -> [ACCEPTED] -> [FINAL]`

Each status change is requested by the DIP author and reviewed by the DIP editors. Please include a link to where people should continue discussing your DIP. The DIP editors will process these requests as per the conditions below.
  * **Active** – Some Informational and Process DIPs may also have a status of “Active” if they are never meant to be completed. 
  * **Work in progress** (WIP) – Once the champion has asked the community whether an idea has any chance of support, they will write a draft DIP as a pull request **<<NEEDS LINK**. Consider including an implementation if this will aid people in studying the DIP.
    * :arrow_right: Draft – If agreeable, DIP editor will assign the DIP a number (generally the issue or PR number related to the DIP). The DIP editor will not unreasonably deny an DIP.
    * :x: Draft – Reasons for denying draft status include being too unfocused, too broad, duplication of effort, being technically unsound, not providing proper motivation or addressing backwards compatibility, or not in keeping with the DERO philosophy **<<NEEDS CREATION&LINK**.
  * **Draft** – Once the first draft has been merged, you may submit follow-up pull requests with further changes to your draft until such point as you believe the DIP to be mature and ready to proceed to the next status. An DIP in draft status must be implemented to be considered for promotion to the next status (ignore this requirement for core DIPs).
    * :arrow_right: Last Call – If agreeable, the DIP editor will assign Last Call status and set a review end date `(review-period-end)`, normally 14 days later.
    * :x: Last Call – A request for Last Call status will be denied if material changes are still expected to be made to the draft. We hope that DIPs only enter Last Call once, so as to avoid unnecessary noise on the RSS feed.
  * **Last Call** – This DIP will listed prominently on the website **<<NEEDS LINKK** (subscribe via RSS at last-call.xml **<<NEEDS LINKK**).
    * :x: A Last Call which results in material changes or substantial unaddressed technical complaints will cause the DIP to revert to Draft.
    * :arrow_right: Accepted (Core DIPs only) – A successful Last Call without material changes or unaddressed technical complaints will become Accepted.
    * :arrow_right: Final (Not core DIPs) – A successful Last Call without material changes or unaddressed technical complaints will become Final.
  * **Accepted (Core DIPs only)** – This DIP is in the hands of the DERO client developers. Their process for deciding whether to encode it into their clients as part of a hard fork is not part of the DIP process.
    * :arrow_right: Final – Standards Track Core DIPs must be implemented in at least three viable DERO clients before it can be considered Final. When the implementation is complete and adopted by the community, the status will be changed to “Final”.
  * **Final** – This DIP represents the current state-of-the-art. A Final DIP should only be updated to correct errata.
  
Other exceptional statuses include:

  * **Deferred** – This is for core DIPs that have been put off for a future hard fork.
  * **Rejected** – An DIP that is fundamentally broken or a Core DIP that was rejected by the Core Devs and will not be implemented.
  * **Active** – This is similar to Final, but denotes an DIP which may be updated without changing its DIP number.
  * **Superseded** – An DIP which was previously final but is no longer considered state-of-the-art. Another DIP will be in Final status and reference the Superseded DIP.

# DIP Header Preamble 
Each DIP must begin with an RFC 822 style header preamble, preceded and followed by three hyphens (`---`). The headers must appear in the following order. Headers marked with “*” are optional and are described below. All other headers are required.

`category:` DIP

`ref:` sequential number determined by the author

`title:`

`author:` <a list of the author’s or authors’ name(s) and/or username(s), or name(s) and email(s). Details are below.>

`* discussions-to:` <a url pointing to the official discussion thread>

status: <Draft	Last Call	Accepted	Final	Active	Deferred	Rejected	Superseded>

`* review-period-end:`

`type:` <Standards Track (Core, Networking, Interface, ERC)	Informational	Meta>


`created:`

`* updated:`

`* requires:` <DIP number(s)>

`* replaces:` <DIP number(s)>

`* superseded-by:` <DIP number(s)>

`* resolution:` <a url pointing to the resolution of this DIP>

Headers that permit lists must separate elements with commas.

Headers requiring dates will always do so in the format of ISO 8601 (yyyy-mm-dd).

`author` header
The `author` header optionally lists the names, email addresses or usernames of the authors/owners of the DIP. Those who prefer anonymity may use a username only, or a first name and a username. The format of the author header value must be:

> Random J. User <address@dom.ain>

or

> Random J. User (@username)

if the email address or GitHub username is included, and

> Random J. User

if the email address is not given.

`resolution header`
The `resolution` header is required for Standards Track DIPs only. It contains a URL that should point to an email message or other web resource where the pronouncement about the DIP is made.

`discussions-to header`
While an DIP is a draft, a discussions-to header will indicate the mailing list or URL where the DIP is being discussed. As mentioned above, examples for places to discuss your DIP include Dero topics on Gitter, an issue in this repo or in a fork of this repo, Dero devs (this is suitable for DIPs that may be contentious or have a strong governance aspect), and Reddit r/dero ** << NEEDS A CHECK WHERE THIS WOULD BE **.

No `discussions-to` header is necessary if the DIP is being discussed privately with the author.

As a single exception, discussions-to cannot point to GitHub pull requests.

`type` header
The `type` header specifies the type of DIP: Standards Track, Meta, or Informational. If the track is Standards please include the subcategory (core, networking, interface, or ERC).

`category` header
The `category` header specifies the DIP’s category. This is required for standards-track DIPs only.

`created` header
The `created` header records the date that the DIP was assigned a number. Both headers should be in yyyy-mm-dd format, e.g. 2001-08-14.

`updated` header
The `updated` header records the date(s) when the DIP was updated with “substantial” changes. This header is only valid for DIPs of Draft and Active status.

`requires` header
DIPs may have a `requires` header, indicating the DIP numbers that this DIP depends on.

`superseded-by` and `replaces` headers
DIPs may also have a `superseded-by` header indicating that an DIP has been rendered obsolete by a later document; the value is the number of the DIP that replaces the current document. The newer DIP must have a replaces header containing the number of the DIP that it rendered obsolete.

# History 
This document was derived heavily from Etherium's [EIP-1](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1) which was in turn derived from Bitcoin’s [BIP-0001](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips) written by Amir Taaki which in turn was derived from Python’s [PEP-0001](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/). In many places text was simply copied and modified. These original authors are not responsible for its use in the Dero Improvement Process, and should not be bothered with technical questions specific to Dero or the DIP. Please direct all comments to the DIP editors.
